Description
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  This program computes the Huffmann Codes of strings for a given file.
  The program is designed to work generally for any set of input files
  however, as the input files indicate,  the focus of this project is
  to compare Huffmann Encodings of Presidential Speeches from different
  time periods. 


Install + Run
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  To install and make, type the following commands in your terminal
    $ cd src
    $ make clean
    $ make
  
  To run, 
    $ ./huff -b ../input/<filename>.txt -i ../input/<filename>.txt -o ../output/<filename>.huff
    where 
	-b is the Buildfile - the file from where the huffman code dictionary is built
	-i is the input file - the file to encode
	-o is the output code

  Note:
    This assumes that the original directory structure was
    was maintained when the file was untarred. Otherwise
    one may need to specify the full path to input files.
